# FINDMINE Feed Documentation

To optimize FINDMINE performance, we would like to receive in-stock product information down to sku at the color level.

These data points do not need to be in separate field FINDMINE will just need a way to grab this data.

### Data points we will need per product

#### Required data:

##### Product Id down to color 
We do not want each size of an item in the feed, this ID will be the unique identifier in our system that will be used to call the FM API or FM JS module

##### Title

##### Price
Product price

##### Availability
In Stock or Out of Stock

##### Image
Product image url

##### URL
URL for the product detail page

##### Category Id - 
Should map to site categories (breadcrumbs) as opposed to generic categories like Google Categories

##### Note: 
The fields in your feed do not need to be named exactly as indicated. We can map your values to ours. For example, your feed may include Image URL instead of Image, etc.
